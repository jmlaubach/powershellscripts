# **Test Script for Sending Email**

I created this script to test out sending emails in Powershell. This example will send an email in Office365.
Certain elements are included since it will act as a piece of a larger Powershell script to automate new hires. Eventually
this will be part of that script to automatically email the new hire's manager needed login information.

I've also included some rudimentary prompts to allow you to input variables which assign values for aspects of the email
such as who you're sending it to, the manager name, etc.
