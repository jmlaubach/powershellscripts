# **My Learning Powershell Journey**

I've created this repository to work on Powershell scripts that I put together as I work on learning Powershell. 
Many of these specific scripts are chosen because I needed to make certain aspects of my job easier and quicker
to do, such as automating the onboarding process. These Powershell scripts will gradually be improve and tweaked
as I clean them up and learn more as I go.
